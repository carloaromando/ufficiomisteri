**RADAR**\
Daniele Castellano, Bruno Zocca.

Radar consists in two stories told as one book with a double cover. \
Each illustrator draws and narrates an event. The two paths undertaken by the characters \
start from distant places (the space and the abyss) in order to meet at the center of the book.
