**Il Bosco dei Gatto'Orchi**

Mistero V: Il Bosco dei Gatt’Orchi is the result of the memories trade project started in 2016: the service offers the opportunity for anyone to forget episodes of their past, earning some money. Ufficio Misteri undertakes to transform the fragments of memory into drawings, and then resell them to the general public, allocating a small percentage of gains to the forgetful. Examining the memories proposed by the public, Ufficio Misteri has identified some curious similarities between the cases: the past of three people was haunted by sinister feline presences, evoked by a common sense of guilt and a trauma removed in childhood.

Who is the one that got a bit carried away.
